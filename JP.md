3. Problem.

The problem Deal Hero solves is the time-consuming and inefficient process of manually searching for the best deals across various e-commerce sites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy.

Shoppers often spend hours browsing multiple sites, checking for price drops, and comparing offers, only to miss out on the most significant savings. With prices fluctuating frequently, it's challenging to stay informed on when to make a purchase at the best possible price.

Deal Hero automates this process by continuously scanning popular retail websites, notifying users of price changes, and helping them make smarter shopping decisions effortlessly.

All of this results in you saving both time and money, without the hassle of constantly monitoring prices themselves.


4. Advantages.

Deal Hero offers several key advantages that make it stand out in the crowded deal-finding app market:

- Custom Wishlist Tracking:
Users can add their specific wishlist items, and Deal Hero monitors them exclusively, eliminating the noise of unrelated deals. Users only get notified for products they care about (icebox feat.), making the app more targeted.

- Automation of Deal Hunting:
Deal Hero eliminates the need for manual searching across multiple sites. Hands-free price checking gives users more convenience compared to similar apps.

- Comprehensive Retail Coverage:
Deal Hero leverages Oxylabs.io's powerful web scraping technology to monitor a wide range of e-commerce platforms, ensuring extensive deal coverage across industries, from electronics to home goods.

- Email Price Drop Alerts (Icebox Feature):
The app notifies users via email as soon as the price of an item on their wishlist drops, ensuring they never miss out on a bargain. This timely notification system gives users a competitive edge in securing deals before they sell out.

- Graphics for Historical Price Data (Icebox Feature):
Deal Hero goes beyond real-time updates by providing users with historical price trends for products. This feature helps users make informed decisions about when to buy, ensuring they truly get the best deal possible.

What Differentiates Deal Hero from Others?

- Customization and Simplicity: Many deal apps flood users with promotions and sponsored ads, but Deal Hero focuses on a clean, easy-to-use interface that highlights what matters mostâ€”personalized deal alerts and accurate price tracking.

- Oxylabs.io Integration: By utilizing advanced web scraping technologies, Deal Hero ensures reliable and accurate data from multiple sources, even for websites with heavy anti-scraping measures like CAPTCHA.

- Cross-platform Price Comparison: Deal Hero doesn't just track deals from one store; it compares prices across several platforms simultaneously, giving users the ability to make direct comparisons within the app.

Deal Hero works by leveraging web scraping technologies to monitor and gather real-time data from various e-commerce websites.

# Here's a breakdown of how the app operates and what makes it effective:

1. Wishlist Setup and Tracking

User Input: The user starts by adding a product they're interested in to their wishlist within the Deal Hero app. This could be anything from electronics, clothing, or home goods from popular online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.

Scraping Initialization: Once a product is added, Deal Hero kicks off its scraping process. It monitors prices on these platforms using web scraping techniques provided by Oxylabs.io, which includes automated bots that mimic human browsing to gather information from web pages.

2. Real-Time Price Monitoring

Continuous Monitoring: Deal Hero will periodically check the prices of the items on the user's wishlist by scraping the target e-commerce websites.

Proxy Management: Using proxy management from Oxylabs, Deal Hero is able to bypass anti-scraping measures like CAPTCHAs or geographic restrictions.

3. Alerts and Notifications (icebox feature).

Price Drop Alerts: The app will compare the price saved in the database (previous price) to the latest price and calculate the difference. If a difference is found, the app sends a real-time notification to the user. For instance, if a laptop's price drops from $999 to $849, Deal Hero immediately alerts the user so they can take advantage of the discount.

4. Cross-Platform Price Comparisons

Multi-Retailer Comparison: Deal Hero scrapes multiple e-commerce platforms for the same product, allowing users to compare prices across retailers without manually searching on different websites. 

For example, if a user adds a camera to their wishlist, Deal Hero can pull prices from Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, showing all available offers in one view.

Example: If the camera is priced at $500 on Amazon, $480 on Walmart, and $490 on Best Buy, Deal Hero will sort and display these prices in one dashboard, helping users make informed decisions.

5. Historical Price Tracking (icebox feature).

Tracking Price History: The app tracks historical price data for products, showing users how the price has fluctuated over time. This feature helps users determine if a current sale is truly a good deal or if it's better to wait for a bigger discount.

Example: If a product typically sells for $100 but dropped to $80 during previous sales, the user can see the trend and anticipate future price drops.

Example Workflow:

Adding a Product: A user adds a pair of headphones from Amazon to their wishlist.
Scraping: Deal Hero starts scraping Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for the same model of headphones.

Comparison View: The user can view that the same headphones are still $150 on Amazon and $140 on Best Buy, making Walmart the best choice.

Price Drop: A week later, Walmart drops the price from $150 to $120. Deal Hero sends a notification to the user with this update.

Purchase Decision: The user is offered "Buy Now" links that redirect to the corresponding e-commerce site, to buy the headphones from Walmart potentially saving $30.

By automating these processes, Deal Hero offers users a time-saving, reliable solution to finding the best deals on the products they care about. The integration with Oxylabs.io ensures the app can handle scraping efficiently while bypassing anti-scraping rate limiting and banning.
